# Python has several built-in data structures.
# They include: 1. Lists
#               2. Tuples
#               3. Dictionaries
#               4. Sets
# Several operations, known as methods, can be performed on these data structures

# 1. Lists
my_list = [1,2, True, 23.32, 'Hello','World']
my_list.append(23)
print(my_list)
# lists are mutable s

# 2. Dictionaries
empty_dict = dict()
new_dict = {}
my_profile = {"github": "Harrisonkamau", "company": "Andela", "age": 24}
# Dictionaries are mutable and hence their values can be modified

# 3. Tuples
# One major attribute of a tuple is immutability

my_tup = (12, 24.1, True, "Hello")

# 4. Sets
my_set = {1,2,3,True, 32.32}
