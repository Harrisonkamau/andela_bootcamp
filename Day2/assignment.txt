How do we make sure that our code works?
** It depends on what you mean by making sure that your code works
- write clean and correct code - master syntax
- use names that describe what a function, class or a variable does
- testing it by using good unit tests to make sure that your code does what you want
- consult other developers and seeking their contributions
- git pull for peer code reviews
- motivation - be motivated to code or write a certain program
- self-doubt, do not just have a perfect theoretical explanation of how certain code works but be practical
      - see to it that you can write such a comprehensively code all by yourself
- Software has bugs.This is normal! Impatience - debugging is a part of a developer's life.
  Sometimes bugs can be hectic but one has to be patient and not just focus on
  skipping through the project or whatever assignment
  - Breaking code into manageable churns
